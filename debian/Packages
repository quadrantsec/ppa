Description: Meer is a dedicated spooler for Suricata and Sagan.
 This means that as Suricata or Sagan write alerts out to a file,
 Meer can ‘follow’ that file and store the alert information into
 a database. You can think of the “spool” file as a 'queuing' system
 for alerts from Suricata or Sagan. Using a “spooling” system ensures
 the delivery of alerts to a back end database. This task was
 traditionally accomplished by using a file format called "unified2"
 which was developed by the SourceFire/Snort team and a program
 called Barnyard2. While unified2 has been useful, its binary
 nature makes it difficult to work with and has not been extended
 in quite sometime. Meer uses Suricata and Sagan's "EVE" output
 formats instead of unified2. EVE is a text file that contains JSON
 which makes it more easy to work with. The EVE output also contains
 valuable information that does not exist in unified2.

Description: High performance, real-time log analysis &
 correlation engine Sagan is an open source (GNU/GPLv2)
 multi-threaded, high performance, real-time log analysis
 & correlation engine developed by Quadrant Information
 Security that runs on Unix operating systems. It is
 written in C and uses a multi-threaded architecture to
 deliver high performance log & event analysis. Sagan's
 structure and rules work similarly to the Sourcefire
 Snort IDS/IPS engine. This allows Sagan to be compatible
 with Snort rule management software and give Sagan the
 ability to correlate with Snort IDS/IPS data. Sagan can
 record events to the Snort unified2 output format which
 makes Sagan compatible with user interfaces such as Snorby,
 Sguil, BASE and proprietary consoles. Sagan supports
 different output formats for reporting and analysis, log
 normalization, script execution on event detection, automatic
 firewall support via Snortsam, GeoIP detection/alerting,
 multi-line log support, and time sensitive alerting.
